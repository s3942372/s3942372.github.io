/*If you read further on, this comment will make a lot more sense, but I decided to make the background a solid black. 
This is partially because as stated, I could not create a similar border to those on the comic page in the areas I had 
clipped out. And so, because it looked fairly uneven and I'm a perfectionist, I have made the background black in order 
to blend everything in. Could I have just erased all the borders? Yes. Did I? No. I want it known that I at least tried 
to follow the styling of the comic panels as close as possible.
Another reason I chose to make the background black however was so that the panel colours stood out a lot more. Black provides 
a nice contrast against other colours, making them stand out more, appearing more vibrant. This makes you focus on what is in the 
foreground (the frames) more than the background.*/

  /*I chose to use the colour gradient of red for the frames because of a few reasons. Firstly, the character that appears 
  on the comic page is wearing a red space suit and I wished to pay homage to that. I had originally tried using a background-
  gradient (so a coloured circle blending into a differently coloured background to closer emulate the comic panels, but it 
  looked bad, like really bad. Getting rid of the gradient aspect and just having the circle against a coloured frame looked 
  pretty terrible too, so I decided against it.
  I still wanted to create a gradient aspect to my design though, and so I decided to create the gradient using the frames. 
  Originally in the comic panel, you can feel a sense of motion from the way the panels were drawn, with certain frames missing 
  borders to create a bigger picture such as where the character has jumped off a cliff and is falling through the sky. Other 
  frames included their borders to give a sensation of crampness (especially in contrast to the previous open frames) and action 
  as well, such as when the character climbs up and down. I wanted to simulate the feeling of motion through the use of the coloured 
  framess. By having a gradient, with frames being different in colour from others, I wanted to make something that would draw in 
  a person's eyes and have them follow the path made. 
  It also kind of reminds me of when those ads/lights flash by through the windows when you're on the subway/metro/bullet train (at 
  least, the ones in China), only slowed down and taken apart frame by frame. So yes, hopefully I managed to somewhat simulate the 
  idea of motion with the gradients.


  In hindsight, the more I look at the browser the more it's starting to look like the large and small intestines. I have managed to 
  recreate the human digestive system apparently. I'm very sorry if you are easily disturbed or were eating when you read this, but 
  I'm not changing my colour choice because red is such a dynamic colour. It's often associated with speed and put on race cars for a 
  reason after all.*/
