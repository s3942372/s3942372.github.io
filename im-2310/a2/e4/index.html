        <!-- I have placed the mute/unmute button and volume slider next to the play/pause button because in most video playing websites, that is where these tend 
        to be positioned. -->

        <input id="volumeSlider" type = "range" min = "0" max = "100" value = "100" step = "1">
        <!-- For my extra feature on the media player, I have chosen to implement a volume slider. Mainly because I have already asked if I could. and so 
        I know that I can and am allowed to make this my extra feature. The other reason I chose to implement this is because strangely enough, most people 
        I know or have seen adjusts the volume of the videos they watch on YouTube and other similar sites (Vimeo, Bilibili, etc.) through the mute/unmute button 
        below the video. I suppose it's to not mess with the audio settings of anything else they have, such as games, and because many videos have different 
        volumes - I can have my volume at exactly 50, and some videos would be at an acceptable volume, but others would either whisper quiet or eardrum-
        shattering. Being able to control the volume of a video directly and not have to change the audio settings of one's computer is so very convenient and 
        saves any extra time-and-patience-wasting fiddling that someone might need to do. Furthermore, this piece of media is more of an audio piece rather than 
        a visual one. Like I said further down, rather than it being something meant for sitting down and enjoyed visually, the clip is more so something you 
        keep playing in the background as you engage in other activities. -->

        <progress class="video-progress-bar" id="progressBar" type = "range" value="0"></progress>

        <div id="TimeBox">
          <span id="currentTimeText">00:00</span> / <span id="durationTimeText">04:00</span>
        </div>
        <!-- As can be seen, originally I had wanted to have my addition of one extra feature be a time update function as I thought that out of all the 
        possible additions that can be made to a media player, this would be the most useful one. One, you can see how long the duration of the media is, 
        and how far into it you've gotten/how long you have watched for. Two, if you particularly liked a part or wanted to replay/go back to a specific 
        part of the video, you can easily find it if you know at what time/second/minute that part occurred at. Unfortunately, however, I was not able to 
        implement it, and so had to give up as I had a presentation on Thursday afternoon and had to make time to prepare for that. Still, very upset at 
        the missed opportunity. -->

        <!-- Also, if the TimeBox had worked it wouldn't have been placed in a div by itself but rather together with the progress bar. -->

        <!-- I have decided to make this div box visible so that there is a general idea as to what this should look like. Please note that the acual extra 
        element I'm doing for this assignment is actually the volume slider, not this. -->

      <!-- I chose not to create the loop button because you can replay a video simply by pressing the very start of the progress bar. Also, I have actually 
      never used the loop button on Youtube before. Even if I wanted to watch something again I'll just refresh the page. -->

      <!-- This applies for the rewind and fastForward buttons too, I don't find these functions very necessary when I can just click back to the part I 
      want to re-watch. -->

      <!-- I chose not to create the fullScreen button because, well, you can zoom in on your computer/laptop if you absolutely want to see everything in a 
      bigger format (it's also because I couldn't and didn't have enough time to figure the coding needed out, but that's not the important part. Yup, not 
      relevant whatsover). Furthermore, there isn't actually much going on in terms of the visual aspect of the media. Yes, it's a bit of a visual overload 
      with trippy imagery resembling Rorschach's inkblot tests, and polygonal shapes that are constantly shifting around - all in similar hues of neon purple 
      pink (really makes you wonder if this is what being high is like). But ignoring those bits, nothing is really happening. Rather than sitting down and 
      watching the video, the clip is more so something you keep playing in the background as you do something, anything else. As such, I can't really justify 
      needing a fullScreen button. Sure, design-wise it might balance out the bar at the bottom of the video, with the play/pause button at the bottom-left 
      corner and the fullScreen button at the bottom-right, but that's not enough justification for me to implement this one. At least I don't think so. -->
