            Upon opening the webpage, the first thing that draws the eyes is the blackness of the screen, closely followed
            by the (almost) blinding white of the various icons lining the top and left side of the page. It is eerily (eerily, 
            because the black screen truly does invoke a somewhat creey feeling) reminiscent of Adobe's Photoshop and 
            Illustrator, even more so MS Paint, though a very much simplified version of them.

        </h2>
        <p>
            For the first two minutes of interacting with the webpage I was scribbling on the screen. I keep changing the
            shape of the pen, from a circle to a square, then to a rectangle, trying to find one I was satisfied with (I 
            liked the square the most, it was quite satisfying to draw with it). I then moved on to messing around with the 
            pen size slider. Upon changing the size to the largest it could go (a size 20), I started trying out the different 
            shades and patterns available at the upper right corner of the screen. I finally spent the rest of my time trying 
            to colour in the rest of the page, completely ignoring the bucket tool. I don't know why, but the minute I marred 
            the black canvas with a smear of white, I just wanted to fill the rest of it in. I wasn't going to take the easy way 
            out either, oh no. I HAD to do this by hand.

            What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I spent the most time engaging with the canvas and tools available. I was scribbling away, constantly drawing 
            new images, then refreshing the page, then starting all over again. It was fascinating watching how white lines 
            against a black background can form together to shape something. It gives off a different feeling from black lines 
            against white, and was reminiscent of those scratch papers one would, as a child, beg their parents to buy a book 
            of (at least I did). Of course this is different in that those are usually coloured, whereas this is black and white, 
            but the same principles apply. You feel as though you are slowly clearing away a film or muck or something of the 
            like to reveal something wonderful right underneath, the diamond buried under the dung hill, you could say.

        <p>
            During that initial two minutes I spent on the webpage, I was constantly clicking and swiping away. I was
            DETERMINED to colour in the entire page with just the brush tool, the fill bucket tool be damned. It was almost
            therapeutic, the way colouring books are, calming and rendering me absolutely ansentminded, almost half asleep,
            and just swiping away. Of course, that's when I accidently scrolled the wheel of my mouse, and discovered that
            there was an even bigger area to the canvas I absolutely needed to fill in. Also discovered that you can zoom out, 
            but that wasn't important at the time.

        <p>
            I suppose the intended primary goal of the interactive experience was to compulse the users into scribbling on
            the canvas. It certainly has worked on me.

            What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?
        </h2>
        <p>
            While the interactive experience does not explicitly state outright that it wants you to interact with it, to
            draw on it, it does tacitly imply this. It is a blank, black canvas, practically inviting someone to just click on
            it and see what happens. And once they do, they see how the screen is affected, how it is changed. There is now a 
            spot of something different, a small space of white amidst all the black, and that's when you get it. Those who 
            are artistically inclined would happily use this as an opportunity to draw, possibly exploring the use of negative 
            spaces and what they can create with them. Even those who don't enjoy art would be enthralled by the simple functions 
            of clicking and moving the mouse to have more spots of white appear. Humans are simplistic creatures at times - we 
            enjoy simple activities because we like doing things and seeing things happen. This interactive experience practically 
            pushes all the right buttons to get people to engage with it.

        </h2>
        <p>
            This experience should be interacted with for as long and however much you want. It is a tool in which you can
            use to create little drawings and scribbles. You can use it to take notes (albeit very shaky and wobbly notes).
            It's potential as something to be used is almost limitless, as it does not really have a limit on what it can do
            as a simplistic creative tool. Even if you refresh the webpage, the website automatically saves your works. Even
            if you choose to create a new canvas, however big you want, you have the option to save or export the image 
            created first. And you can access this interactive experience anywhere as long as you have a connection to the 
            internet. You can scribble away on your computer or IPad or phone, unlike other art applications such as MS Paint 
            or Adobe's Illustrator and Photoshop, the former only available on computers and the latters only extend their 
            usage to Ipads and drawing tablets, all of which are bulky and heavy to carry around.

        <p>
            I believe the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time just fine. Just by
            clicking around, you can easily figure out what the function of each object is and how the experience operates.
            The icons representing functions such as settings, brush and eraser are easily recognisable for what they are. The
            'File' button also functions similar to that of most document and creative softwares.

            As mentioned previously, the interactive experience references other art and creative softwares such as Adobe's
            Illustrator and Photoshop, as well as MS Paint. It is, however, a much more simplified version of those
            applications (on top of being free), with much less functional tools usually seen such as the eyedrop tool,
            shape and line tools, and basic colour swatches.

            What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?
        </h2>
        <p>
            For how you should feel when engaging with this experience, it depends on how you usually feel when using those
            references. How do you feel when creating art? People tend to feel all sorts of emotions; some are happy
            drawing, others are sad or angry or frustrated and channel it into their artwork. That is the point of creating
            art after all, you are trying to convey something, and so the emotional range during those moments can't be
            simply stated as happy, or sad. So if I must answer, the references suggest that you should be free to feel however you
            feel when using the interactive experience. Be happy and draw little ducklings, or be sad and draw a storm. It doesn't
            matter, so long as you feel something (...or not. You can remain emotionless as you draw too, it's up to you. Freedom of
            choice and all that).

            What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The most frustrating aspect of the interaction is simply that it does not have any colours to use other than
            black, white, and the various shades and patterns also available (though those tend to be black and white too). 
            While it is fun and nice to explore how negative spaces can create images on the canvas, the lack of colour 
            options is a fairly large limiter to what you can create, as drawings with many details may not have as much 
            of an impact or show as much detail as it could have with colours included. Of course, you can still create 
            details using the shade and pattern options in the upper right corner of the screen, however it does not provide 
            quite the same effect or range as colours do, and thus can cause some works to fall short of what they could be.

        <p>
            The most satisfying element of the interaction was that I could draw whenever and whatever I went. For such a
            simplistic tool, it has such potential for utilisation. For so long as I wish, I can draw whenever and whatever
            I want on it, and it is free to use, which is more than what I can say for Adobe's software. There is also a
            simplistic sort of pleasure in marring a blank canvas. All in all, the interaction by itself with all its
            elements form a fairly satisfying experience.
